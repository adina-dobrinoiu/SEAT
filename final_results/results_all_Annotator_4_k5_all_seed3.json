In this way, you as a municipality become self-sufficient while it is affordable for the vast majority of residents. Residents who would not be able to participate financially, must be able to use the solar energy, as they currently purchase electricity from their supplier.\nArgument: (you as a municipality become self-sufficient while it is affordable for the vast majority of residents) AND (they currently purchase electricity from their supplier)\nEmotion: caring, excitement, optimism\nSentiment: Somewhat positive\nTopic: Municipality and residents engagement in the energy sector\nValues: Self-direction: action, Universalism: concern, Universalism: nature, Universalism: tolerance\n"
