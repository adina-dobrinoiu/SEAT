So I actually think this is a difficult statement, but I think the idea of helping certain parts of the Netherlands through sustainable energy is a good idea that needs to be used more.\nArgument: (you have to have so many enerie generators)\n\nSentence: The municipality must support energy generation by local energy cooperatives. The municipality should not put on too big pants when it comes to large-scale energy storage. At most, only for your own municipality.

A fairly large wind farm is already coming near me, between Zurich and Witmarsum.  I think that's enough for S\u00fadwest-Frysl\u00e2n.  The idea of making S\u00fadwest-Frysl\u00e2n the supplier of the Netherlands seems to me to be a bad idea.  We have wind here, so let's limit ourselves to windmills.

Windmills are not an issue, we have enough of them in the municipality and we no longer want windmills that pollute the horizon.\nArgument: (we have enough of them in the municipality) AND (we no longer want windmills that pollute the horizon)\n\nSentence: We have the space in the countryside to generate more than we consume. We owe our entire polder country to wind energy. The wind is nice here. Let's do more than our part here. They are opportunities. A new landscape is not necessarily a bad landscape. But let the profits descend locally. People have been given a little more to spend, e.g. for sustainable products, which are now slightly more expensive. Living and building land is far too expensive in Ned. Too much money is being knocked out of people's pockets for housing.

Prefer to store a lot and deliver little. This allows us to become independent of the major energy suppliers.\nArgument: (This allows us to become independent of the major energy suppliers)\n\nSentence: This is the best solution for the protection of the landscape. Generating sustainable energy in places (small or large) can cause great annoyance. People will always disagree. In those cases, it may be better for the government to make the decision.   It should not be the case that the 2 large cores in SWF are now also saddled with large-scale energy generation. There are plenty of (remote) places in the municipality where this could also be done without affecting the landscape too much.\nArgument: (There are plenty of (remote) places in the municipality where this could also be done without affecting the landscape too much)\n\nSentence: If the citizens of the municipality see a leading role in this, a pioneering role to enable sustainable energy generation, then this is certainly a consideration.

We want to choose how we make it more sustainable.\nArgument: None\n\nSentence: Is an important element because it allows self-use to be further stimulated. In my opinion, essential.

        "examples": "Sentence: I would like to see a large field of solar panels, worn by the inhabitants themselves, paid for by the inhabitants themselves, the moment a resident leaves for the area he should be able to sell his part back, new residents should also be able to buy a part. In this way, you as a municipality become self-sufficient while it is affordable for the vast majority of residents. Residents who would not be able to participate financially, must be able to use the solar energy, as they currently purchase electricity from their supplier.\nArgument: (you as a municipality become self-sufficient while it is affordable for the vast majority of residents) AND (they currently purchase electricity from their supplier)\n\nSentence: In this way, all residents pay a lot, while a large part of the municipality itself has just invested a lot in insulation and solar panels. The municipality already has a large deficit, so I do not think it is wise to invest in such projects yourself. Sit down with the business community. For the less fortunate it is a godsend, which is why I have given a few points. Perhaps subsidies could be given on the basis of income?\nArgument: (The municipality already has a large deficit)\n\nSentence: Not everyone who wants to can invest in solar panels.  Windmills are not an issue, we have enough of them in the municipality and we no longer want windmills that pollute the horizon.\nArgument: (we have enough of them in the municipality) AND (we no longer want windmills that pollute the horizon)\n\nSentence: I assign points to both \"The municipality takes the lead and unburdens\" and to \"Residents do it themselves\". This seems contradictory, and it is. Nevertheless, I also think the residents' own initiative is important. For support, for social cohesion, but also for management. A local cooperative will be able to supply energy significantly cheaper than a commercial party. I have a hesitation about sustainability. People move, neighborhoods change, engagement can become less. To what extent can a cooperative guarantee that everyone always has access to energy?\nArgument: (the residents' own initiative is important. For support, for social cohesion, but also for management) AND (A local cooperative will be able to supply energy significantly cheaper than a commercial party)\n\nSentence: Control is needed to prevent energy from being generated everywhere and with initiatives that are too small. Moreover, it is good if the government has a finger in the pie and (large) companies do not determine what happens. You certainly need the companies, but the government can keep a grip on this with steering measures (including subsidies, location policy, etc.).\nArgument: (the government can keep a grip on this with steering measures (including subsidies, location policy, etc.))\n\nSentence: Not a good plan!

But here too, the citizens themselves should really be 100% behind it.

However, this often causes a disruption of the landscape / environment (large fields with solar panels, for example)\nArgument: None\n\nSentence: Clustering can be done in places licensed by the municipality, creating at least sufficient capacity for all residents, possibly with the exception of energy guzzlers, from whom own initiative can be expected.\nArgument: None\n\nSentence: private individuals who can afford it and do things approved by the municipality in the context of sustainability, which also fits within the framework of design (i.e. well controlled by the municipality) is a good thing and can contribute to the joint solution\nArgument: None\n\nSentence: An energy cooperative such as the one in IJlst is a good example. No impact on the landscape. Small-scale and close to a business park. Excellent. Even better, of course, is that the roofs are first fully used. If this is not possible, search for double destinations and overhangs (good example, solar park Hemriksein in exit loop N31). Can't fit this against village or city centers (as for example in IJlst). The village mill is also possible, then this should be an existing mill that is scaled up (same mill, only more modern and therefore more MW). No new mills.\nArgument: (No impact on the landscape) AND (Small-scale and close to a business park) AND (the roofs are first fully used)\n\nSentence: We have the space in the countryside to generate more than we consume. We owe our entire polder country to wind energy. The wind is nice here. Let's do more than our part here. They are opportunities. A new landscape is not necessarily a bad landscape. But let the profits descend locally. People have been given a little more to spend, e.g. for sustainable products, which are now slightly more expensive. Living and building land is far too expensive in Ned. Too much money is being knocked out of people's pockets for housing. Because of these high costs, the willingness to invest in sustainability is lower than in the surrounding countries.\nArgument: (We have the space in the countryside to generate more than we consume) AND (We owe our entire polder country to wind energy) AND (The wind is nice here) AND (They are opportunities) AND (A new landscape is not necessarily a bad landscape) AND (People have been given a little more to spend) AND (Living and building land is far too expensive in Ned) AND (Too much money is being knocked out of people's pockets for housing) AND (Because of these high costs)\n\nSentence: Creating something beautiful in a shared community, where everyone contributes to everyone's ability.
