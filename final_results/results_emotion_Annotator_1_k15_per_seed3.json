People will always disagree. In those cases, it may be better for the government to make the decision.   It should not be the case that the 2 large cores in SWF are now also saddled with large-scale energy generation. There are plenty of (remote) places in the municipality where this could also be done without affecting the landscape too much.\nEmotion: approval\n\nSentence: direction from the public party (steering on the fair distribution of benefits and burdens) and ensuring the quality of the landscape\nEmotion: caring\n\nSentence: We have the space in the countryside to generate more than we consume. We owe our entire polder country to wind energy. The wind is nice here. Let's do more than our part here. They are opportunities. A new landscape is not necessarily a bad landscape. But let the profits descend locally. People have been given a little more to spend, e.g. for sustainable products, which are now slightly more expensive. Living and building land is far too expensive in Ned. Too much money is being knocked out of people's pockets for housing. Because of these high costs, the willingness to invest in sustainability is lower than in the surrounding countries.\nEmotion: desire, disappointment, disapproval, optimism\n\nSentence: This statement makes it as if Friesland has to do it alone, while it is precisely nationally that sustainable use must be made. It is precisely cooperation with all provinces that is good because the statement can then become: \"Become an energy supplier to EU surrounding countries.\"\nEmotion: disapproval, optimism\n\nSentence: Can keep the balance between peaple - planet - profit. Although it will soon be in their favor. That is why good agreements must be made with the municipality.\nEmotion: approval, gratitude, optimism\n\nSentence: An energy cooperative such as the one in IJlst is a good example. No impact on the landscape. Small-scale and close to a business park. Excellent. Even better, of course, is that the roofs are first fully used. If this is not possible, search for double destinations and overhangs (good example, solar park Hemriksein in exit loop N31). Can't fit this against village or city centers (as for example in IJlst). The village mill is also possible, then this should be an existing mill that is scaled up (same mill, only more modern and therefore more MW). No new mills.\nEmotion: admiration, approval\n\nSentence: Here I have given 10 points. A fairly large wind farm is already coming near me, between Zurich and Witmarsum.  I think that's enough for S\u00fadwest-Frysl\u00e2n.  The idea of making S\u00fadwest-Frysl\u00e2n the supplier of the Netherlands seems to me to be a bad idea.  We have wind here, so let's limit ourselves to windmills. Then other parts of the country can invest in large-scale solar parks with less wind. Please share the burden.\nEmotion: annoyance, caring, disapproval\n\nSentence: This would be a very good option because the inhabitants can then make their own choices. However, it can also become a mess. So there is a need for direction and frameworks from the province. The costs also influence the choices and most residents have little insight into this.\nEmotion: approval, disapproval\n\nSentence: Some storage is good, but not for all or half of the Netherlands Then we will soon get landscape pollution\nEmotion: disapproval\n\nSentence: I don't think you can leave this entirely to the inhabitants. But in my view, private initiatives should be possible.\nEmotion: caring, disapproval\n\nSentence: I think this is a very good idea because it yields a lot for the municipality and for the Netherlands.

A local cooperative will be able to supply energy significantly cheaper than a commercial party. I have a hesitation about sustainability. People move, neighborhoods change, engagement can become less. To what extent can a cooperative guarantee that everyone always has access to energy?\nEmotion: approval, confusion, curiosity\n\nSentence: This is the best solution for the protection of the landscape. Generating sustainable energy in places (small or large) can cause great annoyance. People will always disagree. In those cases, it may be better for the government to make the decision.   It should not be the case that the 2 large cores in SWF are now also saddled with large-scale energy generation. There are plenty of (remote) places in the municipality where this could also be done without affecting the landscape too much.\nEmotion: approval\n\nSentence: If we are going to get rid of gas, it is important that energy is always available. Prefer to store a lot and deliver little. This allows us to become independent of the major energy suppliers.\nEmotion: desire\n\nSentence: Given the impact of the measures, right behind the front door, it seems better to put the control in the hands of municipalities and residents.

The municipality should not put on too big pants when it comes to large-scale energy storage. At most, only for your own municipality. The idea of becoming the energy supplier of the Netherlands is also megalomaniacal. That's never going to work in SWF. The market only wants to extract as much money as possible from people.\nEmotion: annoyance, disapproval\n\nSentence: Not everyone who wants to can invest in solar panels.

No impact on the landscape. Small-scale and close to a business park. Excellent. Even better, of course, is that the roofs are first fully used. If this is not possible, search for double destinations and overhangs (good example, solar park Hemriksein in exit loop N31). Can't fit this against village or city centers (as for example in IJlst).
