A fairly large wind farm is already coming near me, between Zurich and Witmarsum.  I think that's enough for S\u00fadwest-Frysl\u00e2n.  The idea of making S\u00fadwest-Frysl\u00e2n the supplier of the Netherlands seems to me to be a bad idea.  We have wind here, so let's limit ourselves to windmills. Then other parts of the country can invest in large-scale solar parks with less wind. Please share the burden.\nTopic: Energy storage and supplying energy in The Netherlands, Wind and solar energy\n\nSentence: Not a good plan!

Windmills are not an issue, we have enough of them in the municipality and we no longer want windmills that pollute the horizon.\nTopic: Wind and solar energy, Landscapes and windmills tourism\n\nSentence: We have the space in the countryside to generate more than we consume. We owe our entire polder country to wind energy. The wind is nice here. Let's do more than our part here. They are opportunities. A new landscape is not necessarily a bad landscape. But let the profits descend locally. People have been given a little more to spend, e.g. for sustainable products, which are now slightly more expensive. Living and building land is far too expensive in Ned. Too much money is being knocked out of people's pockets for housing.

We owe our entire polder country to wind energy. The wind is nice here. Let's do more than our part here. They are opportunities. A new landscape is not necessarily a bad landscape. But let the profits descend locally. People have been given a little more to spend, e.g. for sustainable products, which are now slightly more expensive. Living and building land is far too expensive in Ned. Too much money is being knocked out of people's pockets for housing.

Small-scale and close to a business park. Excellent. Even better, of course, is that the roofs are first fully used. If this is not possible, search for double destinations and overhangs (good example, solar park Hemriksein in exit loop N31). Can't fit this against village or city centers (as for example in IJlst). The village mill is also possible, then this should be an existing mill that is scaled up (same mill, only more modern and therefore more MW). No new mills.\nTopic: Wind and solar energy, Landscapes and windmills tourism\n\nSentence: The municipality must support energy generation by local energy cooperatives. The municipality should not put on too big pants when it comes to large-scale energy storage. At most, only for your own municipality. The idea of becoming the energy supplier of the Netherlands is also megalomaniacal. That's never going to work in SWF. The market only wants to extract as much money as possible from people.\nTopic: Municipality and residents engagement in the energy sector, Energy storage and supplying energy in The Netherlands, Market Determination Dynamics\n\nSentence: We have the space in the countryside to generate more than we consume. We owe our entire polder country to wind energy. The wind is nice here. Let's do more than our part here. They are opportunities. A new landscape is not necessarily a bad landscape. But let the profits descend locally. People have been given a little more to spend, e.g. for sustainable products, which are now slightly more expensive. Living and building land is far too expensive in Ned. Too much money is being knocked out of people's pockets for housing. Because of these high costs, the willingness to invest in sustainability is lower than in the surrounding countries.\nTopic: Energy storage and supplying energy in The Netherlands, Landscapes and windmills tourism\n\nSentence: If the citizens of the municipality see a leading role in this, a pioneering role to enable sustainable energy generation, then this is certainly a consideration.

However, this often causes a disruption of the landscape / environment (large fields with solar panels, for example)\nTopic: Wind and solar energy, Landscapes and windmills tourism\n\nSentence: Control is needed to prevent energy from being generated everywhere and with initiatives that are too small.

Windmills are not an issue, we have enough of them in the municipality and we no longer want windmills that pollute the horizon.\nTopic: Wind and solar energy, Landscapes and windmills tourism\n\nSentence: Here I have given 10 points. A fairly large wind farm is already coming near me, between Zurich and Witmarsum.  I think that's enough for S\u00fadwest-Frysl\u00e2n.  The idea of making S\u00fadwest-Frysl\u00e2n the supplier of the Netherlands seems to me to be a bad idea.  We have wind here, so let's limit ourselves to windmills. Then other parts of the country can invest in large-scale solar parks with less wind. Please share the burden.\nTopic: Energy storage and supplying energy in The Netherlands, Wind and solar energy\n\nSentence: I don't see anything in this.

The yield is important and nature and the environment are secondary, if damage occurs there then so be it. Until now, the working method was as just described.

Generating sustainable energy in places (small or large) can cause great annoyance. People will always disagree. In those cases, it may be better for the government to make the decision.   It should not be the case that the 2 large cores in SWF are now also saddled with large-scale energy generation. There are plenty of (remote) places in the municipality where this could also be done without affecting the landscape too much.\nTopic: Energy storage and supplying energy in The Netherlands, Landscapes and windmills tourism\n\nSentence: Control is needed to prevent energy from being generated everywhere and with initiatives that are too small. Moreover, it is good if the government has a finger in the pie and (large) companies do not determine what happens. You certainly need the companies, but the government can keep a grip on this with steering measures (including subsidies, location policy, etc.).\nTopic: Municipality and residents engagement in the energy sector, Market Determination Dynamics\n\nSentence: The municipality must support energy generation by local energy cooperatives. The municipality should not put on too big pants when it comes to large-scale energy storage. At most, only for your own municipality. The idea of becoming the energy supplier of the Netherlands is also megalomaniacal. That's never going to work in SWF.
