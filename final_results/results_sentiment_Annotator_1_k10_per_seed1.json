The value labels relevant to this discussion are:\n    - Self-direction: action: The sentence mentions the residents' initiative and the municipality's role in providing energy, which implies a need for self-directed action.\n    - Stimulation: The sentence mentions the importance of involving citizens in the generation of sustainable energy, which implies a need for stimulation.\n    - Security: societal: The sentence mentions the importance of providing energy to all residents, which implies a need for societal security.\n    - Tradition: The sentence mentions the existing cooperative in IJlst, which implies a need to respect tradition.\n    - Conformity: rules: The sentence mentions the need for control to prevent energy from being generated everywhere, which implies a need for conformity to rules.\n    - Conformity: interpersonal: The sentence mentions the need for coordination and distribution, which implies a need for interpersonal conformity",

In this way, you as a municipality become self-sufficient while it is affordable for the vast majority of residents. Residents who would not be able to participate financially, must be able to use the solar energy, as they currently purchase electricity from their supplier.\nSentiment: Very positive\n\nSentence: Control is needed to prevent energy from being generated everywhere and with initiatives that are too small. Moreover, it is good if the government has a finger in the pie and (large) companies do not determine what happens. You certainly need the companies, but the government can keep a grip on this with steering measures (including subsidies, location policy, etc.).\nSentiment: Neutral\n\nSentence: Coordination and distribution over the entire municipality As an independent party, the municipality can make the choice between the interests of individuals and residential communities\nSentiment: Neutral\n\nSentence: private individuals who can afford it and do things approved by the municipality in the context of sustainability, which also fits within the framework of design (i.e. well controlled by the municipality) is a good thing and can contribute to the joint solution\nSentiment: Very positive\n\nSentence: The best way to guarantee that everyone is supplied with electricity green and reliably is to control everything centrally.\nSentiment: Somewhat positive\n\nSentence: I don't think you can leave this entirely to the inhabitants.
