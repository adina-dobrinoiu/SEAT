It also mentions the influence of costs on choices, which is related to the need for security. Additionally, the need for direction is also related to the concept of conformity: rules. However, these values are not present in the list, so the relevant values are self-direction: action, security: personal, and security: societal.   \n\n\nExplanation for previous annotations:\nThe previous annotations are somewhat negative because the sentence mentions a need for direction and frameworks, implying a negative sentiment towards the current state of affairs. However, it does not express strong negativity or criticism. The tone is more neutral, with a hint of frustration. This is why the sentiment is labeled as somewhat negative.   \n\n\n\n\nPlease provide the relevant value labels for the sentence. \n[\"Self-direction: action\", \"Security: personal\", \"Security: societal\"]",
