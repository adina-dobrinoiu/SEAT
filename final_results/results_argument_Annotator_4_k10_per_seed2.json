The costs also influence the choices and most residents have little insight into this.\nArgument: (the inhabitants can then make their own choices) AND (it can also become a mess)\n\nSentence: Both residents and the municipalities cannot fulfil the task of the RES together, so a small part will be filled by market parties, but the region will decide/benefit from such projects.\nArgument: (Both residents and the municipalities cannot fulfil the task of the RES together)\n\nSentence: Can keep the balance between peaple - planet - profit.

This seems contradictory, and it is. Nevertheless, I also think the residents' own initiative is important. For support, for social cohesion, but also for management. A local cooperative will be able to supply energy significantly cheaper than a commercial party. I have a hesitation about sustainability. People move, neighborhoods change, engagement can become less. To what extent can a cooperative guarantee that everyone always has access to energy?\nArgument: (the residents' own initiative is important.
