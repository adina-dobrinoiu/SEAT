However, the relevant value labels extracted for each sentence are different. It is not the case that all sentences have the same relevant value labels. \n\nThe value labels are extracted based on the sentence context. For example, in the sentence \"Residents can take care of solar panels, heat pumps, etc. POSSIBLY WITH THE HELP OF GOOD FINANCING PROGRAMS.\" the relevant value labels are [\"Self-direction: thought\", \"Self-direction: action\", \"Achievement\", \"Power: resources\", \"Security: personal\"] because the sentence is about residents taking care of solar panels and the role of the municipality.

In this way, you as a municipality become self-sufficient while it is affordable for the vast majority of residents. Residents who would not be able to participate financially, must be able to use the solar energy, as they currently purchase electricity from their supplier.\nSentiment: Somewhat positive\n\nSentence: Residents can take care of solar panels, heat pumps, etc. POSSIBLY WITH THE HELP OF GOOD FINANCING PROGRAMS.\nSentiment: Somewhat positive\n\nSentence: Not everyone who wants to can invest in solar panels.  Windmills are not an issue, we have enough of them in the municipality and we no longer want windmills that pollute the horizon.\nSentiment: Very negative\n\nSentence: If the citizens of the municipality see a leading role in this, a pioneering role to enable sustainable energy generation, then this is certainly a consideration. But here too, the citizens themselves should really be 100% behind it. There is a danger with this option that the main focus of this is on the revenue model, while, in my opinion, it is really mainly about involving citizens in the generation of sustainable energy and consciously working on this.\nSentiment: Somewhat positive\n\nSentence: Not a good plan!

We owe our entire polder country to wind energy. The wind is nice here. Let's do more than our part here. They are opportunities. A new landscape is not necessarily a bad landscape. But let the profits descend locally. People have been given a little more to spend, e.g. for sustainable products, which are now slightly more expensive. Living and building land is far too expensive in Ned. Too much money is being knocked out of people's pockets for housing. Because of these high costs, the willingness to invest in sustainability is lower than in the surrounding countries.\nSentiment: Somewhat negative\n\nSentence: Can keep the balance between peaple - planet - profit. Although it will soon be in their favor. That is why good agreements must be made with the municipality.\nSentiment: Somewhat positive\n\nSentence: Both residents and the municipalities cannot fulfil the task of the RES together, so a small part will be filled by market parties, but the region will decide/benefit from such projects.\nSentiment: Somewhat positive\n"
