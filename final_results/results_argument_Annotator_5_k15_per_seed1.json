We owe our entire polder country to wind energy. The wind is nice here. Let's do more than our part here. They are opportunities. A new landscape is not necessarily a bad landscape. But let the profits descend locally. People have been given a little more to spend, e.g. for sustainable products, which are now slightly more expensive.

And it gives a drive because there will also be recouped.  My preference is mainly for windmills, and solar panels on existing buildings and certainly not for panels on (agricultural) land.\nArgument: (there will also be recouped)\n\nSentence: The market is not a reliable partner. The yield is important and nature and the environment are secondary, if damage occurs there then so be it. Until now, the working method was as just described. Perhaps the municipality can play a coercive role in this and only cooperate with market parties if the damage is 0 or repaired as much as possible at the expense of the market party.\nArgument: (The yield is important and nature and the environment are secondary)\n\nSentence: Here too, a positive effect on the labour market in the region.
