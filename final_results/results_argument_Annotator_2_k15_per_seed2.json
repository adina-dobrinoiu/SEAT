Moreover, it is good if the government has a finger in the pie and (large) companies do not determine what happens. You certainly need the companies, but the government can keep a grip on this with steering measures (including subsidies, location policy, etc.).\nArgument: (prevent energy from being generated everywhere) AND (companies do not determine what happens)\n\nSentence: Better the municipality than a higher government like the province or The Hague. Keep it close to the citizen.\nArgument: (Keep it close to the citizen.)\n\nSentence: Given the impact of the measures, right behind the front door, it seems better to put the control in the hands of municipalities and residents.

The municipality already has a large deficit, so I do not think it is wise to invest in such projects yourself. Sit down with the business community. For the less fortunate it is a godsend, which is why I have given a few points.

In this way, you as a municipality become self-sufficient while it is affordable for the vast majority of residents. Residents who would not be able to participate financially, must be able to use the solar energy, as they currently purchase electricity from their supplier.\nArgument: (municipality become self-sufficient while it is affordable for the vast majority of residents)\n"

It should not be the case that the 2 large cores in SWF are now also saddled with large-scale energy generation. There are plenty of (remote) places in the municipality where this could also be done without affecting the landscape too much.\nArgument: (sustainable energy in places (small or large) can cause great annoyance)\n\nSentence: Control is needed to prevent energy from being generated everywhere and with initiatives that are too small.
