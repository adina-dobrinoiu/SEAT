Windmills are not an issue, we have enough of them in the municipality and we no longer want windmills that pollute the horizon.\nTopic: Wind and solar energy, Landscapes and windmills tourism\n\nSentence: We have the space in the countryside to generate more than we consume. We owe our entire polder country to wind energy. The wind is nice here. Let's do more than our part here. They are opportunities. A new landscape is not necessarily a bad landscape. But let the profits descend locally. People have been given a little more to spend, e.g. for sustainable products, which are now slightly more expensive.

Generating sustainable energy in places (small or large) can cause great annoyance. People will always disagree. In those cases, it may be better for the government to make the decision.   It should not be the case that the 2 large cores in SWF are now also saddled with large-scale energy generation. There are plenty of (remote) places in the municipality where this could also be done without affecting the landscape too much.\nTopic: Municipality and residents engagement in the energy sector, Landscapes and windmills tourism\n\nSentence: An energy cooperative such as the one in IJlst is a good example. No impact on the landscape. Small-scale and close to a business park. Excellent. Even better, of course, is that the roofs are first fully used. If this is not possible, search for double destinations and overhangs (good example, solar park Hemriksein in exit loop N31). Can't fit this against village or city centers (as for example in IJlst). The village mill is also possible, then this should be an existing mill that is scaled up (same mill, only more modern and therefore more MW).

The municipality should not put on too big pants when it comes to large-scale energy storage. At most, only for your own municipality.

Generating far too much energy in our municipality to provide parts of the country with energy.  See point 5!\nTopic: Wind and solar energy\n\nSentence: With more storage, more energy can perhaps be stored at peak times that can be used at another time.  (i.e. ultimately generate less in total capacity)\nTopic: Energy storage in The Netherlands\n\nSentence: An energy cooperative such as the one in IJlst is a good example. No impact on the landscape. Small-scale and close to a business park. Excellent. Even better, of course, is that the roofs are first fully used. If this is not possible, search for double destinations and overhangs (good example, solar park Hemriksein in exit loop N31). Can't fit this against village or city centers (as for example in IJlst). The village mill is also possible, then this should be an existing mill that is scaled up (same mill, only more modern and therefore more MW). No new mills.\nTopic: Municipality and residents engagement in the energy sector, Wind and solar energy, Landscapes and windmills tourism\n\nSentence: Given the installation of wind turbines in IJsselmeer, it would increase the effectiveness of this form of energy generation if efficient storage can take place.\nTopic: Energy storage in The Netherlands, Wind and solar energy\n"

The municipality already has a large deficit, so I do not think it is wise to invest in such projects yourself. Sit down with the business community.

But here too, the citizens themselves should really be 100% behind it. There is a danger with this option that the main focus of this is on the revenue model, while, in my opinion, it is really mainly about involving citizens in the generation of sustainable energy and consciously working on this.\nTopic: Municipality and residents engagement in the energy sector, Market Determination Dynamics\n\nSentence: I don't think you can leave this entirely to the inhabitants. But in my view, private initiatives should be possible.\nTopic: Municipality and residents engagement in the energy sector, Market Determination Dynamics\n\nSentence: The market is not a reliable partner. The yield is important and nature and the environment are secondary, if damage occurs there then so be it. Until now, the working method was as just described. Perhaps the municipality can play a coercive role in this and only cooperate with market parties if the damage is 0 or repaired as much as possible at the expense of the market party.\nTopic: Municipality and residents engagement in the energy sector, Market Determination Dynamics\n\nSentence: I would like to see a large field of solar panels, worn by the inhabitants themselves, paid for by the inhabitants themselves, the moment a resident leaves for the area he should be able to sell his part back, new residents should also be able to buy a part. In this way, you as a municipality become self-sufficient while it is affordable for the vast majority of residents.

This seems contradictory, and it is. Nevertheless, I also think the residents' own initiative is important. For support, for social cohesion, but also for management. A local cooperative will be able to supply energy significantly cheaper than a commercial party. I have a hesitation about sustainability.

So I actually think this is a difficult statement, but I think the idea of helping certain parts of the Netherlands through sustainable energy is a good idea that needs to be used more.\nTopic: \n\nSentence: This is the best solution for the protection of the landscape. Generating sustainable energy in places (small or large) can cause great annoyance. People will always disagree. In those cases, it may be better for the government to make the decision.   It should not be the case that the 2 large cores in SWF are now also saddled with large-scale energy generation. There are plenty of (remote) places in the municipality where this could also be done without affecting the landscape too much.\nTopic: Municipality and residents engagement in the energy sector, Landscapes and windmills tourism\n\nSentence: Control is needed to prevent energy from being generated everywhere and with initiatives that are too small. Moreover, it is good if the government has a finger in the pie and (large) companies do not determine what happens. You certainly need the companies, but the government can keep a grip on this with steering measures (including subsidies, location policy, etc.).\nTopic: Municipality and residents engagement in the energy sector, Market Determination Dynamics\n\nSentence: The municipality must support energy generation by local energy cooperatives. The municipality should not put on too big pants when it comes to large-scale energy storage. At most, only for your own municipality. The idea of becoming the energy supplier of the Netherlands is also megalomaniacal. That's never going to work in SWF. The market only wants to extract as much money as possible from people.\nTopic: Municipality and residents engagement in the energy sector, Market Determination Dynamics\n\nSentence: The best way to guarantee that everyone is supplied with electricity green and reliably is to control everything centrally.\nTopic: Municipality and residents engagement in the energy sector, Market Determination Dynamics\n"
