This seems contradictory, and it is. Nevertheless, I also think the residents' own initiative is important. For support, for social cohesion, but also for management. A local cooperative will be able to supply energy significantly cheaper than a commercial party. I have a hesitation about sustainability. People move, neighborhoods change, engagement can become less.

In this way, you as a municipality become self-sufficient while it is affordable for the vast majority of residents. Residents who would not be able to participate financially, must be able to use the solar energy, as they currently purchase electricity from their supplier.\nArgument: (you as a municipality become self-sufficient while it is affordable for the vast majority of residents) AND (they currently purchase electricity from their supplier)\nEmotion: caring, excitement, optimism\nSentiment: Somewhat positive\nTopic: Municipality and residents engagement in the energy sector\nValues: Self-direction: action, Universalism: concern, Universalism: nature, Universalism: tolerance\n"
