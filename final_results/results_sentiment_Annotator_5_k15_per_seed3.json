We owe our entire polder country to wind energy. The wind is nice here. Let's do more than our part here. They are opportunities. A new landscape is not necessarily a bad landscape. But let the profits descend locally. People have been given a little more to spend, e.g. for sustainable products, which are now slightly more expensive. Living and building land is far too expensive in Ned. Too much money is being knocked out of people's pockets for housing. Because of these high costs, the willingness to invest in sustainability is lower than in the surrounding countries.\nSentiment: Somewhat positive\n\nSentence: This statement makes it as if Friesland has to do it alone, while it is precisely nationally that sustainable use must be made.

No impact on the landscape. Small-scale and close to a business park. Excellent. Even better, of course, is that the roofs are first fully used. If this is not possible, search for double destinations and overhangs (good example, solar park Hemriksein in exit loop N31). Can't fit this against village or city centers (as for example in IJlst). The village mill is also possible, then this should be an existing mill that is scaled up (same mill, only more modern and therefore more MW). No new mills.\nSentiment: Somewhat positive\n\nSentence: Here I have given 10 points. A fairly large wind farm is already coming near me, between Zurich and Witmarsum.  I think that's enough for S\u00fadwest-Frysl\u00e2n.  The idea of making S\u00fadwest-Frysl\u00e2n the supplier of the Netherlands seems to me to be a bad idea.  We have wind here, so let's limit ourselves to windmills. Then other parts of the country can invest in large-scale solar parks with less wind. Please share the burden.\nSentiment: Very negative\n\nSentence: This would be a very good option because the inhabitants can then make their own choices. However, it can also become a mess. So there is a need for direction and frameworks from the province.
