To what extent can a cooperative guarantee that everyone always has access to energy?\nArgument: (The residents' own initiative is important)\nEmotion: annoyance, curiosity, disappointment\nSentiment: Somewhat negative\nTopic: Municipality and residents engagement in the energy sector, Energy storage and supplying energy in The Netherlands, Market Determination Dynamics\nValues: Benevolence: caring, Security: personal, Self-direction: action\n\nSentence: Residents can take care of solar panels, heat pumps, etc. POSSIBLY WITH THE HELP OF GOOD FINANCING PROGRAMS.\nArgument: (Residents can take care of solar panels, heat pumps, etc.)\nEmotion: approval, desire, realization\nSentiment: Somewhat positive\nTopic: Municipality and residents engagement in the energy sector, Wind and solar energy\nValues: Achievement, Benevolence: caring, Benevolence: dependability, Power: dominance, Security: personal, Security: societal, Self-direction: action, Universalism: nature\n\nSentence: I would like to see a large field of solar panels, worn by the inhabitants themselves, paid for by the inhabitants themselves, the moment a resident leaves for the area he should be able to sell his part back, new residents should also be able to buy a part. In this way, you as a municipality become self-sufficient while it is affordable for the vast majority of residents. Residents who would not be able to participate financially, must be able to use the solar energy, as they currently purchase electricity from their supplier.\nArgument: (municipality become self-sufficient while it is affordable for the vast majority of residents)\nEmotion: approval, desire, optimism\nSentiment: Somewhat positive\nTopic: Municipality and residents engagement in the energy sector, Wind and solar energy\nValues: Benevolence: caring, Security: personal, Security: societal, Self-direction: action, Universalism: nature\n\nSentence: An energy cooperative such as the one in IJlst is a good example. No impact on the landscape. Small-scale and close to a business park. Excellent. Even better, of course, is that the roofs are first fully used. If this is not possible, search for double destinations and overhangs (good example, solar park Hemriksein in exit loop N31). Can't fit this against village or city centers (as for example in IJlst). The village mill is also possible, then this should be an existing mill that is scaled up (same mill, only more modern and therefore more MW). No new mills.\nArgument: (No impact on the landscape) AND (roofs are first fully used)\nEmotion: approval, desire, realization\nSentiment: Neutral\nTopic: Wind and solar energy\nValues: Universalism: nature, Universalism: tolerance\n\nSentence: Coordination and distribution over the entire municipality As an independent party, the municipality can make the choice between the interests of individuals and residential communities\nArgument: None\nEmotion: curiosity\nSentiment: Neutral\nTopic: Municipality and residents engagement in the energy sector\nValues: Security: societal\n\nSentence: Not a good plan! Generating far too much energy in our municipality to provide parts of the country with energy.  See point 5!\nArgument: (Generating far too much energy in our municipality)\nEmotion: desire\nSentiment: Somewhat negative\nTopic: Municipality and residents engagement in the energy sector, Energy storage and supplying energy in The Netherlands\nValues: Security: societal, Self-direction: action, Universalism: concern\n\nSentence: If the citizens of the municipality see a leading role in this, a pioneering role to enable sustainable energy generation, then this is certainly a consideration. But here too, the citizens themselves should really be 100% behind it. There is a danger with this option that the main focus of this is on the revenue model, while, in my opinion, it is really mainly about involving citizens in the generation of sustainable energy and consciously working on this.\nArgument: None\nEmotion: approval, fear\nSentiment: Somewhat positive\nTopic: Municipality and residents engagement in the energy sector\nValues: Self-direction: action, Universalism: nature\n\nSentence: In this way, all residents pay a lot, while a large part of the municipality itself has just invested a lot in insulation and solar panels. The municipality already has a large deficit, so I do not think it is wise to invest in such projects yourself. Sit down with the business community. For the less fortunate it is a godsend, which is why I have given a few points. Perhaps subsidies could be given on the basis of income?\nArgument: (municipality already has a large deficit)\nEmotion: caring, disapproval\nSentiment: Neutral\nTopic: Municipality and residents engagement in the energy sector, Wind and solar energy, Market Determination Dynamics\nValues: Benevolence: caring, Security: societal, Universalism: tolerance\n"
