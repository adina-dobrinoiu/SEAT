If this is not possible, search for double destinations and overhangs (good example, solar park Hemriksein in exit loop N31). Can't fit this against village or city centers (as for example in IJlst). The village mill is also possible, then this should be an existing mill that is scaled up (same mill, only more modern and therefore more MW). No new mills.\nArgument: (No impact on the landscape) AND (Small-scale and close to a business park) AND (the roofs are first fully used)\nEmotion: neutral\nSentiment: Somewhat positive\nTopic: Municipality and residents engagement in the energy sector\nValues: Universalism: nature, Universalism: objectivity\n\nSentence: Coordination and distribution over the entire municipality As an independent party, the municipality can make the choice between the interests of individuals and residential communities\nArgument: None\nEmotion: caring, optimism\nSentiment: Somewhat positive\nTopic: Municipality and residents engagement in the energy sector\nValues: Security: societal, Universalism: concern\n\nSentence: Not a good plan! Generating far too much energy in our municipality to provide parts of the country with energy.  See point 5!\nArgument: None\nEmotion: anger, disapproval\nSentiment: Very negative\nTopic: Energy storage and supplying energy in The Netherlands\nValues: Benevolence: caring, Self-direction: action\n\nSentence: If the citizens of the municipality see a leading role in this, a pioneering role to enable sustainable energy generation, then this is certainly a consideration. But here too, the citizens themselves should really be 100% behind it. There is a danger with this option that the main focus of this is on the revenue model, while, in my opinion, it is really mainly about involving citizens in the generation of sustainable energy and consciously working on this.\nArgument: (the citizens themselves should really be 100% behind it)\nEmotion: caring, nervousness, optimism\nSentiment: Neutral\nTopic: Municipality and residents engagement in the energy sector\nValues: Achievement, Security: personal, Self-direction: action, Universalism: nature\n\nSentence: In this way, all residents pay a lot, while a large part of the municipality itself has just invested a lot in insulation and solar panels. The municipality already has a large deficit, so I do not think it is wise to invest in such projects yourself. Sit down with the business community. For the less fortunate it is a godsend, which is why I have given a few points. Perhaps subsidies could be given on the basis of income?\nArgument: (The municipality already has a large deficit)\nEmotion: caring, confusion, disapproval\nSentiment: Somewhat negative\nTopic: Municipality and residents engagement in the energy sector\nValues: Benevolence: caring, Security: personal, Universalism: concern\n"
