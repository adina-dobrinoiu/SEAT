The idea of becoming the energy supplier of the Netherlands is also megalomaniacal. That's never going to work in SWF. The market only wants to extract as much money as possible from people.\nTopic: Municipality and residents engagement in the energy sector, Energy storage and supplying energy in The Netherlands, Wind and solar energy\n\nSentence: Here I have given 10 points. A fairly large wind farm is already coming near me, between Zurich and Witmarsum.  I think that's enough for S\u00fadwest-Frysl\u00e2n.  The idea of making S\u00fadwest-Frysl\u00e2n the supplier of the Netherlands seems to me to be a bad idea.  We have wind here, so let's limit ourselves to windmills. Then other parts of the country can invest in large-scale solar parks with less wind. Please share the burden.\nTopic: Energy storage and supplying energy in The Netherlands, Wind and solar energy\n\nSentence: Not a good plan! Generating far too much energy in our municipality to provide parts of the country with energy.  See point 5!\nTopic: Municipality and residents engagement in the energy sector, Energy storage and supplying energy in The Netherlands\n\nSentence: Not everyone who wants to can invest in solar panels.  Windmills are not an issue, we have enough of them in the municipality and we no longer want windmills that pollute the horizon.\nTopic: Municipality and residents engagement in the energy sector, Wind and solar energy\n\nSentence: We have the space in the countryside to generate more than we consume. We owe our entire polder country to wind energy. The wind is nice here. Let's do more than our part here. They are opportunities. A new landscape is not necessarily a bad landscape. But let the profits descend locally. People have been given a little more to spend, e.g. for sustainable products, which are now slightly more expensive. Living and building land is far too expensive in Ned. Too much money is being knocked out of people's pockets for housing. Because of these high costs, the willingness to invest in sustainability is lower than in the surrounding countries.\nTopic: Wind and solar energy, Landscapes and windmills tourism\n\nSentence: This statement makes it as if Friesland has to do it alone, while it is precisely nationally that sustainable use must be made. It is precisely cooperation with all provinces that is good because the statement can then become: \"Become an energy supplier to EU surrounding countries.\"\nTopic: Municipality and residents engagement in the energy sector, Energy storage and supplying energy in The Netherlands\n\nSentence: If we are going to get rid of gas, it is important that energy is always available. Prefer to store a lot and deliver little. This allows us to become independent of the major energy suppliers.\nTopic: Energy storage and supplying energy in The Netherlands\n\nSentence: This is the best solution for the protection of the landscape. Generating sustainable energy in places (small or large) can cause great annoyance. People will always disagree. In those cases, it may be better for the government to make the decision.   It should not be the case that the 2 large cores in SWF are now also saddled with large-scale energy generation. There are plenty of (remote) places in the municipality where this could also be done without affecting the landscape too much.\nTopic: Energy storage and supplying energy in The Netherlands, Wind and solar energy, Landscapes and windmills tourism\n\nSentence: If the citizens of the municipality see a leading role in this, a pioneering role to enable sustainable energy generation, then this is certainly a consideration. But here too, the citizens themselves should really be 100% behind it. There is a danger with this option that the main focus of this is on the revenue model, while, in my opinion, it is really mainly about involving citizens in the generation of sustainable energy and consciously working on this.\nTopic: Municipality and residents engagement in the energy sector\n\nSentence: Some storage is good, but not for all or half of the Netherlands Then we will soon get landscape pollution\nTopic: Energy storage and supplying energy in The Netherlands, Landscapes and windmills tourism\n\nSentence: I think this is a very good idea because it yields a lot for the municipality and for the Netherlands.

But in my view, private initiatives should be possible.\nTopic: Municipality and residents engagement in the energy sector\n\nSentence: The market is not a reliable partner. The yield is important and nature and the environment are secondary, if damage occurs there then so be it. Until now, the working method was as just described. Perhaps the municipality can play a coercive role in this and only cooperate with market parties if the damage is 0 or repaired as much as possible at the expense of the market party.\nTopic: Municipality and residents engagement in the energy sector, Market Determination Dynamics\n\nSentence: I would like to see a large field of solar panels, worn by the inhabitants themselves, paid for by the inhabitants themselves, the moment a resident leaves for the area he should be able to sell his part back, new residents should also be able to buy a part.

This seems contradictory, and it is. Nevertheless, I also think the residents' own initiative is important. For support, for social cohesion, but also for management. A local cooperative will be able to supply energy significantly cheaper than a commercial party. I have a hesitation about sustainability.

Generating sustainable energy in places (small or large) can cause great annoyance. People will always disagree. In those cases, it may be better for the government to make the decision.   It should not be the case that the 2 large cores in SWF are now also saddled with large-scale energy generation. There are plenty of (remote) places in the municipality where this could also be done without affecting the landscape too much.\nTopic: Energy storage and supplying energy in The Netherlands, Wind and solar energy, Landscapes and windmills tourism\n\nSentence: Control is needed to prevent energy from being generated everywhere and with initiatives that are too small. Moreover, it is good if the government has a finger in the pie and (large) companies do not determine what happens. You certainly need the companies, but the government can keep a grip on this with steering measures (including subsidies, location policy, etc.).\nTopic: Municipality and residents engagement in the energy sector, Energy storage and supplying energy in The Netherlands, Market Determination Dynamics\n\nSentence: The municipality must support energy generation by local energy cooperatives. The municipality should not put on too big pants when it comes to large-scale energy storage. At most, only for your own municipality. The idea of becoming the energy supplier of the Netherlands is also megalomaniacal. That's never going to work in SWF. The market only wants to extract as much money as possible from people.\nTopic: Municipality and residents engagement in the energy sector, Energy storage and supplying energy in The Netherlands, Wind and solar energy\n\nSentence: The best way to guarantee that everyone is supplied with electricity green and reliably is to control everything centrally.\nTopic: Energy storage and supplying energy in The Netherlands, Market Determination Dynamics\n"
