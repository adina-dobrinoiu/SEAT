This suggests that power and security are relevant value labels. The municipality is an independent party, which implies it can make decisions based on its own interests or those of the individuals and residential communities, and thus relates to \"Power: resources\".

The goal is to identify the most relevant values that are implicitly or explicitly mentioned in the sentence. \n\nIn this case, the relevant values are Power: resources and Security: personal.
