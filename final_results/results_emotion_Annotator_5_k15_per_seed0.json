But let the profits descend locally. People have been given a little more to spend, e.g. for sustainable products, which are now slightly more expensive.

In this way, you as a municipality become self-sufficient while it is affordable for the vast majority of residents. Residents who would not be able to participate financially, must be able to use the solar energy, as they currently purchase electricity from their supplier.\nEmotion: approval, caring, desire, excitement, optimism\n\nSentence: private individuals who can afford it and do things approved by the municipality in the context of sustainability, which also fits within the framework of design (i.e. well controlled by the municipality) is a good thing and can contribute to the joint solution\nEmotion: admiration, approval\n\nSentence: An energy cooperative such as the one in IJlst is a good example. No impact on the landscape. Small-scale and close to a business park. Excellent. Even better, of course, is that the roofs are first fully used. If this is not possible, search for double destinations and overhangs (good example, solar park Hemriksein in exit loop N31). Can't fit this against village or city centers (as for example in IJlst). The village mill is also possible, then this should be an existing mill that is scaled up (same mill, only more modern and therefore more MW). No new mills.\nEmotion: admiration, approval, desire, excitement, optimism, pride\n\nSentence: I assign points to both \"The municipality takes the lead and unburdens\" and to \"Residents do it themselves\". This seems contradictory, and it is. Nevertheless, I also think the residents' own initiative is important. For support, for social cohesion, but also for management. A local cooperative will be able to supply energy significantly cheaper than a commercial party. I have a hesitation about sustainability. People move, neighborhoods change, engagement can become less. To what extent can a cooperative guarantee that everyone always has access to energy?\nEmotion: approval, confusion, curiosity, nervousness\n\nSentence: We have the space in the countryside to generate more than we consume. We owe our entire polder country to wind energy. The wind is nice here. Let's do more than our part here. They are opportunities. A new landscape is not necessarily a bad landscape. But let the profits descend locally. People have been given a little more to spend, e.g. for sustainable products, which are now slightly more expensive. Living and building land is far too expensive in Ned. Too much money is being knocked out of people's pockets for housing. Because of these high costs, the willingness to invest in sustainability is lower than in the surrounding countries.\nEmotion: approval, caring, desire, disappointment, nervousness, optimism, pride\n\nSentence: In this way, all residents pay a lot, while a large part of the municipality itself has just invested a lot in insulation and solar panels. The municipality already has a large deficit, so I do not think it is wise to invest in such projects yourself. Sit down with the business community. For the less fortunate it is a godsend, which is why I have given a few points. Perhaps subsidies could be given on the basis of income?\nEmotion: approval, caring, curiosity, desire, nervousness\n\nSentence: This is the best solution for the protection of the landscape. Generating sustainable energy in places (small or large) can cause great annoyance. People will always disagree. In those cases, it may be better for the government to make the decision.   It should not be the case that the 2 large cores in SWF are now also saddled with large-scale energy generation. There are plenty of (remote) places in the municipality where this could also be done without affecting the landscape too much.\nEmotion: approval, caring, optimism\n\nSentence: Not a good plan! Generating far too much energy in our municipality to provide parts of the country with energy.  See point 5!\nEmotion: anger, annoyance, disappointment, disapproval\n\nSentence: Especially financially, this seems to me to be the best choice, and also that in a certain (city) district an equality of the houses there arises and no jumble of possible possibilities.\nEmotion: approval\n\nSentence: People want to be involved in these kinds of decisions.  We want to choose how we make it more sustainable.\nEmotion: desire\n\nSentence: If the citizens of the municipality see a leading role in this, a pioneering role to enable sustainable energy generation, then this is certainly a consideration. But here too, the citizens themselves should really be 100% behind it. There is a danger with this option that the main focus of this is on the revenue model, while, in my opinion, it is really mainly about involving citizens in the generation of sustainable energy and consciously working on this.\nEmotion: approval, curiosity\n\nSentence: Not everyone who wants to can invest in solar panels.  Windmills are not an issue, we have enough of them in the municipality and we no longer want windmills that pollute the horizon.\nEmotion: disapproval\n\nSentence: Is think this is easiest solution and probably the cheapest? However, this often causes a disruption of the landscape / environment (large fields with solar panels, for example)\nEmotion: approval, curiosity, nervousness\n\nSentence: Residents can take care of solar panels, heat pumps, etc. POSSIBLY WITH THE HELP OF GOOD FINANCING PROGRAMS.\nEmotion: annoyance, approval, desire, disapproval\n"

We owe our entire polder country to wind energy. The wind is nice here. Let's do more than our part here. They are opportunities. A new landscape is not necessarily a bad landscape. But let the profits descend locally. People have been given a little more to spend, e.g. for sustainable products, which are now slightly more expensive.
