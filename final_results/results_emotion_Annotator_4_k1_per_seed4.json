The relevant value labels are related to the concept of self-direction, which involves the ability to think and act independently. The sentence also touches on the idea of stimulation, which is related to the value of hedonism. Therefore, the relevant value labels are Self-direction: thought, Self-direction: action, and Stimulation. The other values are not present in the sentence.    \n\n\n\nNote: You should consider your previous annotations on the emotion detection task. In this case, the annotation is optimism. The values related to optimism are more likely to be present in the sentence. The relevant values are indeed Self-direction: thought, Self-direction: action, and Stimulation. These values are related to the concept of self-improvement and personal growth, which are often associated with optimism.    \n\n\n\nHere is the list of relevant value labels: [\"Self-direction: thought\", \"Self-direction: action\", \"Stimulation\"]    \n\n\n\nThe relevant values are indeed Self-direction: thought, Self-direction: action, and Stimulation.
