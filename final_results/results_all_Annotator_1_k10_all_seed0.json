The yield is important and nature and the environment are secondary, if damage occurs there then so be it. Until now, the working method was as just described. Perhaps the municipality can play a coercive role in this and only cooperate with market parties if the damage is 0 or repaired as much as possible at the expense of the market party.\nArgument: (The yield is important) AND (nature and the environment are secondary)\nEmotion: disapproval, optimism\nSentiment: Somewhat negative\nTopic: Municipality and residents engagement in the energy sector\nValues: Universalism: nature\n\nSentence: I would like to see a large field of solar panels, worn by the inhabitants themselves, paid for by the inhabitants themselves, the moment a resident leaves for the area he should be able to sell his part back, new residents should also be able to buy a part. In this way, you as a municipality become self-sufficient while it is affordable for the vast majority of residents.

This seems contradictory, and it is. Nevertheless, I also think the residents' own initiative is important. For support, for social cohesion, but also for management. A local cooperative will be able to supply energy significantly cheaper than a commercial party. I have a hesitation about sustainability. People move, neighborhoods change, engagement can become less.

No impact on the landscape. Small-scale and close to a business park. Excellent. Even better, of course, is that the roofs are first fully used. If this is not possible, search for double destinations and overhangs (good example, solar park Hemriksein in exit loop N31). Can't fit this against village or city centers (as for example in IJlst). The village mill is also possible, then this should be an existing mill that is scaled up (same mill, only more modern and therefore more MW). No new mills.\nArgument: None\nEmotion: admiration, approval\nSentiment: Somewhat positive\nTopic: Wind and solar energy\nValues: Universalism: nature\n\nSentence: Coordination and distribution over the entire municipality As an independent party, the municipality can make the choice between the interests of individuals and residential communities\nArgument: (as an independent party)\nEmotion: realization\nSentiment: Neutral\nTopic: Municipality and residents engagement in the energy sector\nValues: Self-direction: action, Self-direction: thought\n\nSentence: Not a good plan!

The municipality already has a large deficit, so I do not think it is wise to invest in such projects yourself. Sit down with the business community. For the less fortunate it is a godsend, which is why I have given a few points. Perhaps subsidies could be given on the basis of income?\nArgument: None\nEmotion: realization\nSentiment: Somewhat positive\nTopic: Municipality and residents engagement in the energy sector\nValues: Universalism: objectivity\n"
