Generating sustainable energy in places (small or large) can cause great annoyance. People will always disagree. In those cases, it may be better for the government to make the decision.   It should not be the case that the 2 large cores in SWF are now also saddled with large-scale energy generation. There are plenty of (remote) places in the municipality where this could also be done without affecting the landscape too much.\nArgument: (There are plenty of (remote) places in the municipality where this could also be done without affecting the landscape too much)\nEmotion: annoyance, disapproval\nSentiment: Neutral\nTopic: Energy storage and supplying energy in The Netherlands\nValues: Security: societal, Universalism: nature, Universalism: objectivity\n\nSentence: An energy cooperative such as the one in IJlst is a good example. No impact on the landscape. Small-scale and close to a business park. Excellent. Even better, of course, is that the roofs are first fully used. If this is not possible, search for double destinations and overhangs (good example, solar park Hemriksein in exit loop N31). Can't fit this against village or city centers (as for example in IJlst).
