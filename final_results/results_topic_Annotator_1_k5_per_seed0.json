We want to choose how we make it more sustainable.\nTopic: Municipality and residents engagement in the energy sector\n\nSentence: We have the space in the countryside to generate more than we consume. We owe our entire polder country to wind energy. The wind is nice here. Let's do more than our part here. They are opportunities. A new landscape is not necessarily a bad landscape. But let the profits descend locally. People have been given a little more to spend, e.g. for sustainable products, which are now slightly more expensive. Living and building land is far too expensive in Ned. Too much money is being knocked out of people's pockets for housing. Because of these high costs, the willingness to invest in sustainability is lower than in the surrounding countries.\nTopic: Wind and solar energy\n\nSentence: This would be a very good option because the inhabitants can then make their own choices. However, it can also become a mess. So there is a need for direction and frameworks from the province. The costs also influence the choices and most residents have little insight into this.\nTopic: Municipality and residents engagement in the energy sector\n\nSentence: Competition from each other is never bad as long as one can suffer from each other. There are too many options, the consumer must be able to choose.\nTopic: Market Determination Dynamics\n"

For the less fortunate it is a godsend, which is why I have given a few points. Perhaps subsidies could be given on the basis of income?",
