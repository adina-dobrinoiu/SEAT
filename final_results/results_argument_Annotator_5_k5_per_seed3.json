This is a win-win situation. If the municipality can provide the land, residents will be able to generate their own energy.\nArgument: None\n\nSentence: The municipality takes the lead and unburdens, and the residents do it themselves. This is a contradictory situation.\nArgument: None\n\nSentence: In this way, the residents are self-sufficient and the municipality is able to provide the necessary support.\nArgument: None\n\nSentence: It is a great idea for the residents to be able to generate their own energy.\nArgument: None\n\n    Predefined Values:\n    ['Self-direction: thought', 'Self-direction: action', 'Stimulation', 'Hedonism', 'Achievement', 'Power: dominance', 'Power",

There is a danger with this option that the main focus of this is on the revenue model, while, in my opinion, it is really mainly about involving citizens in the generation of sustainable energy and consciously working on this.\nArgument: (it is really mainly about involving citizens in the generation of sustainable energy and conciously working on this)\n\nSentence: I would like to see a large field of solar panels, worn by the inhabitants themselves, paid for by the inhabitants themselves, the moment a resident leaves for the area he should be able to sell his part back, new residents should also be able to buy a part. In this way, you as a municipality become self-sufficient while it is affordable for the vast majority of residents. Residents who would not be able to participate financially, must be able to use the solar energy, as they currently purchase electricity from their supplier.\nArgument: None\n\nSentence: Control is needed to prevent energy from being generated everywhere and with initiatives that are too small. Moreover, it is good if the government has a finger in the pie and (large) companies do not determine what happens. You certainly need the companies, but the government can keep a grip on this with steering measures (including subsidies, location policy, etc.).\nArgument: None\n\nSentence: Coordination and distribution over the entire municipality As an independent party, the municipality can make the choice between the interests of individuals and residential communities\nArgument: None\n"
