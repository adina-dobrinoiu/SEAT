People move, neighborhoods change, engagement can become less. To what extent can a cooperative guarantee that everyone always has access to energy?\nArgument: (the residents' own initiative is important) AND (People move, neighborhoods change, engagement can become less.)\nEmotion: nervousness, optimism\nSentiment: Somewhat positive\nTopic: Municipality and residents engagement in the energy sector, Market Determination Dynamics\nValues: Power: dominance, Security: personal, Security: societal, Universalism: concern\n\nSentence: Residents can take care of solar panels, heat pumps, etc. POSSIBLY WITH THE HELP OF GOOD FINANCING PROGRAMS.\nArgument: (WITH THE HELP OF GOOD FINANCING PROGRAMS)\nEmotion: approval, optimism\nSentiment: Somewhat negative\nTopic: Municipality and residents engagement in the energy sector, Wind and solar energy\nValues: Achievement, Face, Self-direction: action\n\nSentence: I would like to see a large field of solar panels, worn by the inhabitants themselves, paid for by the inhabitants themselves, the moment a resident leaves for the area he should be able to sell his part back, new residents should also be able to buy a part. In this way, you as a municipality become self-sufficient while it is affordable for the vast majority of residents. Residents who would not be able to participate financially, must be able to use the solar energy, as they currently purchase electricity from their supplier.\nArgument: (it is affordable for the vast majority of residents)\nEmotion: caring, optimism\nSentiment: Somewhat negative\nTopic: Municipality and residents engagement in the energy sector\nValues: Achievement, Benevolence: caring, Face, Security: personal\n\nSentence: An energy cooperative such as the one in IJlst is a good example. No impact on the landscape. Small-scale and close to a business park. Excellent. Even better, of course, is that the roofs are first fully used. If this is not possible, search for double destinations and overhangs (good example, solar park Hemriksein in exit loop N31). Can't fit this against village or city centers (as for example in IJlst). The village mill is also possible, then this should be an existing mill that is scaled up (same mill, only more modern and therefore more MW). No new mills.\nArgument: (The village mill is also possible) AND (same mill, only more modern)\nEmotion: \nSentiment: Somewhat positive\nTopic: Wind and solar energy, Landscapes and windmills tourism\nValues: Achievement, Universalism: nature\n\nSentence: Coordination and distribution over the entire municipality As an independent party, the municipality can make the choice between the interests of individuals and residential communities\nArgument: (an independent party)\nEmotion: approval\nSentiment: Very negative\nTopic: Municipality and residents engagement in the energy sector\nValues: Security: societal, Universalism: objectivity\n\nSentence: Not a good plan! Generating far too much energy in our municipality to provide parts of the country with energy.  See point 5!\nArgument: (Generating far too much energy in our municipality to provide parts of the country with energy)\nEmotion: disapproval\nSentiment: Neutral\nTopic: Energy storage and supplying energy in The Netherlands\nValues: Power: dominance, Self-direction: thought\n\nSentence: If the citizens of the municipality see a leading role in this, a pioneering role to enable sustainable energy generation, then this is certainly a consideration. But here too, the citizens themselves should really be 100% behind it. There is a danger with this option that the main focus of this is on the revenue model, while, in my opinion, it is really mainly about involving citizens in the generation of sustainable energy and consciously working on this.\nArgument: (If the citizens of the municipality see a leading role in this, a pioneering role to enable sustainable energy generation)\nEmotion: \nSentiment: Neutral\nTopic: Municipality and residents engagement in the energy sector\nValues: Benevolence: dependability, Power: resources, Security: societal\n\nSentence: In this way, all residents pay a lot, while a large part of the municipality itself has just invested a lot in insulation and solar panels. The municipality already has a large deficit, so I do not think it is wise to invest in such projects yourself. Sit down with the business community. For the less fortunate it is a godsend, which is why I have given a few points. Perhaps subsidies could be given on the basis of income?\nArgument: (The municipality already has a large deficit)\nEmotion: \nSentiment: Neutral\nTopic: Municipality and residents engagement in the energy sector\nValues: Power: dominance, Security: personal, Universalism: concern\n\nSentence: With this proposal it is of course difficult because you have to have so many enerie generators. So I actually think this is a difficult statement, but I think the idea of helping certain parts of the Netherlands through sustainable energy is a good idea that needs to be used more.\nArgument: (you have to have so many enerie generators)\nEmotion: approval, caring, nervousness, optimism\nSentiment: Somewhat negative\nTopic: Energy storage and supplying energy in The Netherlands\nValues: Achievement, Benevolence: caring, Benevolence: dependability, Face, Security: societal, Universalism: nature\n\nSentence: This is the best solution for the protection of the landscape. Generating sustainable energy in places (small or large) can cause great annoyance. People will always disagree. In those cases, it may be better for the government to make the decision.   It should not be the case that the 2 large cores in SWF are now also saddled with large-scale energy generation. There are plenty of (remote) places in the municipality where this could also be done without affecting the landscape too much.\nArgument: None\nEmotion: \nSentiment: Somewhat positive\nTopic: Energy storage and supplying energy in The Netherlands, Landscapes and windmills tourism\nValues: Conformity: rules, Security: societal, Universalism: nature\n\nSentence: Control is needed to prevent energy from being generated everywhere and with initiatives that are too small. Moreover, it is good if the government has a finger in the pie and (large) companies do not determine what happens. You certainly need the companies, but the government can keep a grip on this with steering measures (including subsidies, location policy, etc.).\nArgument: None\nEmotion: \nSentiment: Neutral\nTopic: Municipality and residents engagement in the energy sector, Market Determination Dynamics\nValues: Security: societal\n\nSentence: The municipality must support energy generation by local energy cooperatives. The municipality should not put on too big pants when it comes to large-scale energy storage. At most, only for your own municipality. The idea of becoming the energy supplier of the Netherlands is also megalomaniacal. That's never going to work in SWF. The market only wants to extract as much money as possible from people.\nArgument: None\nEmotion: \nSentiment: Somewhat negative\nTopic: Municipality and residents engagement in the energy sector, Energy storage and supplying energy in The Netherlands, Market Determination Dynamics\nValues: Conformity: rules, Self-direction: action\n\nSentence: The best way to guarantee that everyone is supplied with electricity green and reliably is to control everything centrally.\nArgument: None\nEmotion: realization\nSentiment: Somewhat negative\nTopic: Energy storage and supplying energy in The Netherlands\nValues: Security: societal, Universalism: nature, Universalism: objectivity\n"
