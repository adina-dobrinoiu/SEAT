So I actually think this is a difficult statement, but I think the idea of helping certain parts of the Netherlands through sustainable energy is a good idea that needs to be used more.\nArgument: (you have to have so many enerie generators)\n\nSentence: The municipality must support energy generation by local energy cooperatives. The municipality should not put on too big pants when it comes to large-scale energy storage. At most, only for your own municipality. The idea of becoming the energy supplier of the Netherlands is also megalomaniacal. That's never going to work in SWF. The market only wants to extract as much money as possible from people.\nArgument: (That's never going to work in SWF) AND (The market only wants to extract as much money as possible from people)\n\nSentence: Here I have given 10 points. A fairly large wind farm is already coming near me, between Zurich and Witmarsum.  I think that's enough for S\u00fadwest-Frysl\u00e2n.  The idea of making S\u00fadwest-Frysl\u00e2n the supplier of the Netherlands seems to me to be a bad idea.  We have wind here, so let's limit ourselves to windmills. Then other parts of the country can invest in large-scale solar parks with less wind. Please share the burden.\nArgument: (A fairly large wind farm is already coming near me, between Zurich and Witmarsum) AND (We have wind here)\n\nSentence: Not a good plan! Generating far too much energy in our municipality to provide parts of the country with energy.  See point 5!\nArgument: None\n\nSentence: Not everyone who wants to can invest in solar panels.  Windmills are not an issue, we have enough of them in the municipality and we no longer want windmills that pollute the horizon.\nArgument: (we have enough of them in the municipality) AND (we no longer want windmills that pollute the horizon)\n\nSentence: We have the space in the countryside to generate more than we consume. We owe our entire polder country to wind energy. The wind is nice here. Let's do more than our part here. They are opportunities. A new landscape is not necessarily a bad landscape. But let the profits descend locally. People have been given a little more to spend, e.g. for sustainable products, which are now slightly more expensive. Living and building land is far too expensive in Ned. Too much money is being knocked out of people's pockets for housing. Because of these high costs, the willingness to invest in sustainability is lower than in the surrounding countries.\nArgument: (We have the space in the countryside to generate more than we consume) AND (We owe our entire polder country to wind energy) AND (The wind is nice here) AND (They are opportunities) AND (A new landscape is not necessarily a bad landscape) AND (People have been given a little more to spend) AND (Living and building land is far too expensive in Ned) AND (Too much money is being knocked out of people's pockets for housing) AND (Because of these high costs)\n\nSentence: This statement makes it as if Friesland has to do it alone, while it is precisely nationally that sustainable use must be made. It is precisely cooperation with all provinces that is good because the statement can then become: \"Become an energy supplier to EU surrounding countries.\"\nArgument: (the statement can then become: \"Become an energy supplier to EU surrounding countries.\")\n\nSentence: If we are going to get rid of gas, it is important that energy is always available. Prefer to store a lot and deliver little. This allows us to become independent of the major energy suppliers.\nArgument: (This allows us to become independent of the major energy suppliers)\n\nSentence: This is the best solution for the protection of the landscape. Generating sustainable energy in places (small or large) can cause great annoyance. People will always disagree. In those cases, it may be better for the government to make the decision.   It should not be the case that the 2 large cores in SWF are now also saddled with large-scale energy generation. There are plenty of (remote) places in the municipality where this could also be done without affecting the landscape too much.\nArgument: (There are plenty of (remote) places in the municipality where this could also be done without affecting the landscape too much)\n\nSentence: If the citizens of the municipality see a leading role in this, a pioneering role to enable sustainable energy generation, then this is certainly a consideration. But here too, the citizens themselves should really be 100% behind it. There is a danger with this option that the main focus of this is on the revenue model, while, in my opinion, it is really mainly about involving citizens in the generation of sustainable energy and consciously working on this.\nArgument: (the citizens themselves should really be 100% behind it)\n\nSentence: Some storage is good, but not for all or half of the Netherlands Then we will soon get landscape pollution\nArgument: (Then we will soon get landscape pollution)\n\nSentence: I think this is a very good idea because it yields a lot for the municipality and for the Netherlands. Because the municipality can earn a lot from it and so can the Netherlands.\nArgument: (it yields a lot for the municipality and for the Netherlands) AND (the municipality can earn a lot from it and so can the Netherlands)\n\nSentence: People want to be involved in these kinds of decisions.  We want to choose how we make it more sustainable.\nArgument: None\n\nSentence: Is an important element because it allows self-use to be further stimulated. In my opinion, essential. Furthermore, biomass and pallet stoves should be removed from the package as soon as possible. Then rather nuclear energy as a transition!\nArgument: (it allows self-use to be further stimulated)\n"

The idea of becoming the energy supplier of the Netherlands is also seen as a megalomaniacal notion, suggesting that the speaker values benevolence and dependability, as well as concern and tolerance for the natural environment.
