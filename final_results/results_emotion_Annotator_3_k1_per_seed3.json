The value labels relevant to this context are Power: resources and Security: societal. The mention of \"more energy\" and \"less in total capacity\" implies the importance of resource management and societal security in the context of energy storage. The value of Power: resources is relevant because the sentence discusses the potential to store energy at peak times and use it later, which involves managing resources. The value of Security: societal is relevant because the sentence implies that the ability to store energy can have a positive impact on societal security by reducing the need for energy generation at peak times. The value of Power: resources is more directly relevant to the sentence, but Security: societal is also relevant due to the societal implications of energy storage.    \n\n\n\nThis response is based on the assumption that the value annotator has a basic understanding of the context and the value labels, and is able to identify the most relevant labels for the given sentence.
