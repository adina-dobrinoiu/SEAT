Here is the correct output:\n\n[\"Self-direction: thought\", \"Self-direction: action\", \"Stimulation\"]\n\n\nHere is the correct reasoning:\n\nThe sentence talks about the importance of self-use and stimulating it further. It also mentions the opinion of the speaker, which implies that the speaker values self-direction. The word \"stimulation\" directly suggests that the relevant value label is \"Stimulation\". There is no mention of any other values like hedonism, power, security, etc. in the sentence. Therefore, the correct output should be the list of relevant value labels.  The output should be [\"Self-direction: thought\", \"Self-direction: action\", \"Stimulation\"]. \n\n\nLet's try again.",
