We owe our entire polder country to wind energy. The wind is nice here. Let's do more than our part here. They are opportunities. A new landscape is not necessarily a bad landscape. But let the profits descend locally. People have been given a little more to spend, e.g. for sustainable products, which are now slightly more expensive. Living and building land is far too expensive in Ned. Too much money is being knocked out of people's pockets for housing. Because of these high costs, the willingness to invest in sustainability is lower than in the surrounding countries.\nEmotion: caring, disapproval, optimism, pride\n\nSentence: This statement makes it as if Friesland has to do it alone, while it is precisely nationally that sustainable use must be made.

No impact on the landscape. Small-scale and close to a business park. Excellent. Even better, of course, is that the roofs are first fully used. If this is not possible, search for double destinations and overhangs (good example, solar park Hemriksein in exit loop N31). Can't fit this against village or city centers (as for example in IJlst). The village mill is also possible, then this should be an existing mill that is scaled up (same mill, only more modern and therefore more MW). No new mills.\nEmotion: neutral\n\nSentence: Here I have given 10 points. A fairly large wind farm is already coming near me, between Zurich and Witmarsum.  I think that's enough for S\u00fadwest-Frysl\u00e2n.  The idea of making S\u00fadwest-Frysl\u00e2n the supplier of the Netherlands seems to me to be a bad idea.  We have wind here, so let's limit ourselves to windmills. Then other parts of the country can invest in large-scale solar parks with less wind. Please share the burden.\nEmotion: anger, annoyance, disapproval\n\nSentence: This would be a very good option because the inhabitants can then make their own choices. However, it can also become a mess. So there is a need for direction and frameworks from the province.

So I actually think this is a difficult statement, but I think the idea of helping certain parts of the Netherlands through sustainable energy is a good idea that needs to be used more.\nEmotion: optimism\n\nSentence: This is the best solution for the protection of the landscape. Generating sustainable energy in places (small or large) can cause great annoyance. People will always disagree. In those cases, it may be better for the government to make the decision.   It should not be the case that the 2 large cores in SWF are now also saddled with large-scale energy generation. There are plenty of (remote) places in the municipality where this could also be done without affecting the landscape too much.\nEmotion: annoyance, disapproval\n\nSentence: The generation and consumption is never simultaneous as you can store create your independence Also I see employment here Now I want solar panels but hear in our street that the solar inverter regularly switches off 250v.  This is now an obstacle to purchasing panels, so network / infrastructure will have to be made suitable\nEmotion: curiosity, desire, disappointment\n\nSentence: With more storage, more energy can perhaps be stored at peak times that can be used at another time.  (i.e. ultimately generate less in total capacity)\nEmotion: neutral\n\nSentence: Control is needed to prevent energy from being generated everywhere and with initiatives that are too small.

You certainly need the companies, but the government can keep a grip on this with steering measures (including subsidies, location policy, etc.).\nEmotion: neutral\n\nSentence: Not a good plan! Generating far too much energy in our municipality to provide parts of the country with energy.  See point 5!\nEmotion: anger, disapproval\n\nSentence: Is an important element because it allows self-use to be further stimulated. In my opinion, essential. Furthermore, biomass and pallet stoves should be removed from the package as soon as possible. Then rather nuclear energy as a transition!\nEmotion: optimism\n\nSentence: If the citizens of the municipality see a leading role in this, a pioneering role to enable sustainable energy generation, then this is certainly a consideration. But here too, the citizens themselves should really be 100% behind it.

Prefer to store a lot and deliver little. This allows us to become independent of the major energy suppliers.\nEmotion: neutral\n\nSentence: An energy cooperative such as the one in IJlst is a good example. No impact on the landscape. Small-scale and close to a business park. Excellent. Even better, of course, is that the roofs are first fully used. If this is not possible, search for double destinations and overhangs (good example, solar park Hemriksein in exit loop N31). Can't fit this against village or city centers (as for example in IJlst). The village mill is also possible, then this should be an existing mill that is scaled up (same mill, only more modern and therefore more MW). No new mills.\nEmotion: neutral\n\nSentence: We have the space in the countryside to generate more than we consume. We owe our entire polder country to wind energy. The wind is nice here. Let's do more than our part here. They are opportunities. A new landscape is not necessarily a bad landscape. But let the profits descend locally. People have been given a little more to spend, e.g. for sustainable products, which are now slightly more expensive. Living and building land is far too expensive in Ned. Too much money is being knocked out of people's pockets for housing. Because of these high costs, the willingness to invest in sustainability is lower than in the surrounding countries.\nEmotion: caring, disapproval, optimism, pride\n\nSentence: Not everyone who wants to can invest in solar panels.  Windmills are not an issue, we have enough of them in the municipality and we no longer want windmills that pollute the horizon.\nEmotion: anger, annoyance, disapproval\n\nSentence: Given the installation of wind turbines in IJsselmeer, it would increase the effectiveness of this form of energy generation if efficient storage can take place.\nEmotion: neutral\n\nSentence: The best way to guarantee that everyone is supplied with electricity green and reliably is to control everything centrally.\nEmotion: caring, realization\n"

The idea of making S\u00fadwest-Frysl\u00e2n the supplier of the Netherlands seems to me to be a bad idea.  We have wind here, so let's limit ourselves to windmills.
