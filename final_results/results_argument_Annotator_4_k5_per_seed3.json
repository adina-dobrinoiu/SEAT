This suggests self-direction and action. The cheaper energy supply from a local cooperative implies hedonism. The achievement of sustainability and energy independence is also a key aspect. The municipality's control over energy generation and distribution is related to power and resources. The residents' access to energy is a matter of personal security. Tradition is mentioned as a factor that might hinder the adoption of new energy solutions. Conformity to rules and interpersonal relationships is also relevant in this context. Finally, the importance of social cohesion and support for residents is reflected in benevolence and concern for the community. The tolerance of different perspectives and ideas is also essential for a successful energy transition. \n\n    Note: The value annotations provided are based on the arguments and sentences provided and the predefined values.
