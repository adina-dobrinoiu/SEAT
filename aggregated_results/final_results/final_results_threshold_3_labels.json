  "I assign points to both \"The municipality takes the lead and unburdens\" and to \"Residents do it themselves\". This seems contradictory, and it is. Nevertheless, I also think the residents' own initiative is important. For support, for social cohesion, but also for management. A local cooperative will be able to supply energy significantly cheaper than a commercial party. I have a hesitation about sustainability. People move, neighborhoods change, engagement can become less. To what extent can a cooperative guarantee that everyone always has access to energy?": {

  "Here I have given 10 points. A fairly large wind farm is already coming near me, between Zurich and Witmarsum.  I think that's enough for Súdwest-Fryslân.  The idea of making Súdwest-Fryslân the supplier of the Netherlands seems to me to be a bad idea.  We have wind here, so let's limit ourselves to windmills. Then other parts of the country can invest in large-scale solar parks with less wind. Please share the burden.": {

  "We have the space in the countryside to generate more than we consume. We owe our entire polder country to wind energy. The wind is nice here. Let's do more than our part here. They are opportunities. A new landscape is not necessarily a bad landscape. But let the profits descend locally. People have been given a little more to spend, e.g. for sustainable products, which are now slightly more expensive. Living and building land is far too expensive in Ned. Too much money is being knocked out of people's pockets for housing. Because of these high costs, the willingness to invest in sustainability is lower than in the surrounding countries.": {

  "An energy cooperative such as the one in IJlst is a good example. No impact on the landscape. Small-scale and close to a business park. Excellent. Even better, of course, is that the roofs are first fully used. If this is not possible, search for double destinations and overhangs (good example, solar park Hemriksein in exit loop N31). Can't fit this against village or city centers (as for example in IJlst). The village mill is also possible, then this should be an existing mill that is scaled up (same mill, only more modern and therefore more MW). No new mills.": {

In those cases, it may be better for the government to make the decision.   It should not be the case that the 2 large cores in SWF are now also saddled with large-scale energy generation. There are plenty of (remote) places in the municipality where this could also be done without affecting the landscape too much.": {
